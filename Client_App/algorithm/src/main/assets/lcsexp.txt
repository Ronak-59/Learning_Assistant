In above table:-
For input X=aab and Y=aba:
1.	We first fill 1st column and 1st row with zero that is when either of m and n are 0.
2.	If X[i]!=Y[j],then check top and left elements and write the maximum from them  and put (|,<--) By default : (|).
3.	If X[i]==Y[j] then 1 is added to diagonal element and diagonal arrow is put (\).
4.	For length of LCS and to find LCS.  The length of LCS is the last entry of table that is 2 in above case.
5.	To find LCS walk from last entry in direction of arrow entries in reverse order.
In above eg. LCS length=2
                         LCS is ab
